A class extends another class
An interface extends another interface
BUT
A class implements an interface

extends is for when inheriting from a base class (i.e. extending its functionality)
implements is for when implementing an interface


THEN how does interface differ from class?
- an interface can never be instantiated
- members of an interface are always declared as public
- contains abstract method i.e. methods without the body
- another class to implements the keyword
- cannot contain final or static method
- cannot have constructors
- can extend any number of interfaces but cannot implement any interface
